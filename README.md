As a dedicated software development graduate from Monash University, I am passionate about the ever- evolving IT field and committed to continuous learning. My experience in university projects and extracurricular activities has sharpened my teamwork and communication skills, allowing me to thrive in collaborative environments and bring innovative ideas to life. I have successfully utilized my skills in two full-scale capstone projects for clients, as well as in various personal projects. I wish to leverage my diverse skill set to make a meaningful impact in a dynamic team.
