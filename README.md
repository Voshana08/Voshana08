As a dedicated software engineering student at Monash University, I'm deeply passionate about the ever-evolving field of information technology. 
Committed to continuous learning, I believe staying ahead in the IT sector requires constant skill development. 
I actively pursue knowledge through virtual platforms, ensuring a competitive edge. Collaborating in university development teams has honed my teamwork and communication skills. 
Notably, I've applied my skills in two full-scale development projects as part of my capstone projects. Post-graduation, I'm eager to contribute to the IT sector,
leveraging my knowledge, passion, and skills to make a meaningful impact on society.
